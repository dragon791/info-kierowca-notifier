"""Auto-heals an expired info-kierowca.pl session.

Launches Chrome (in its own throwaway profile, separate from your regular
browsing) pointed at the login page, waits for you to scan the mObywatel QR
code in the app, then captures the resulting session cookies the moment
they appear and writes session.json — no manual "launch Chrome, log in, run
a script" dance required.

Run by hand:

    python -m info_kierowca_notifier.auth.session

or invoked automatically by notifier.py (see trigger_auto_refresh() in
auth.launch) whenever a check comes back auth_expired. A lock file at
~/.local/state/info-kierowca-notifier/auto-refresh.lock stops it firing
more than once concurrently — delete that file if a previous run crashed
without cleaning up.

Nothing but the two info-kierowca.pl session cookies is read or sent
anywhere; see browser.cdp's docstring for the debug-port security note.

# it can later be unregistered; see remove_observer_script()) so it's
# already watching the DOM before the first paint of *every* document in
# this tab — including cross-origin OAuth redirects — and clicks the
# instant a target appears, instead of waiting on our next poll tick. This
# is what makes the click-through effectively instant rather than bounded
# by a sleep interval.
#
# Watches `attributes` as well as `childList`/`characterData`: some chooser
# screens reveal the next tile by toggling a class/hidden attribute on an
# already-present element rather than inserting a new node, which this
# observer used to miss entirely — the click then only happened on the next
# Python-side fallback poll (try_auto_click, see wait_for_cookies), which is
# exactly the ~1s-ish hang reported right before the QR page. Disconnects
# itself once targets[0] is clicked (see __ikw_findAndClick's sessionStorage
# flag above) so a same-document re-render that brings the chooser back
# (e.g. picking a different login method) doesn't get auto-clicked forward
# again.
#
# That sessionStorage flag is deliberately origin-scoped (see
# CLICKABLE_HELPERS_JS's own comment on __ikw_findAndClick) — which covers
# same-origin back-navigation, but not the whole story: this login chain
# genuinely crosses at least one real origin boundary (info-kierowca.pl ->
# the gov.pl/login.gov.pl family), and the flag is only ever *set* on
# whichever origin the final tile happens to live on. Back out far enough to
# reach an earlier, different-origin page in the chain and this same script
# gets re-registered (Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument fires again for
# any new document) onto a page where sessionStorage has no flag at all —
# and would auto-click forward all over again, undoing the user's own
# intentional back navigation. Sets a `window.__ikw_diag.observer_injected`
# marker the instant it runs (read by __ikw_pageDiag() above) purely as a
# Windows-stall diagnostic — confirms this script actually executed for the
# current document, not just that Chrome accepted the registration call.
# The actual fix for the cross-origin gap is Python-side, not another
# in-page flag: wait_for_cookies() unregisters this script outright
# (remove_observer_script(), via Page.removeScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument)
# the moment it sees targets[0] has been reached (by itself or by this
# observer), so no *future* document — on any origin, forward or backward —
# gets this script injected again at all.
#
# Confirmed live 2026-07-18: on the podmiotyzewnetrzne.login.gov.pl tile
# chooser specifically, this observer's callback (and a setInterval placed
# alongside it, tried and discarded) never fires at all even though the
# tiles are fully rendered and clickable within ~1s — the MutationObserver
# and any in-page timers registered via this
# Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument-injected script go silently inert on
# that one page. A *fresh* Runtime.evaluate call from Python-side (i.e.
# try_auto_click, called on its own separate CDP connection) always finds
# and clicks the tile instantly regardless. So the reliable fix isn't a
# better in-page watcher — it's not leaving that fallback 3s idle; see
# wait_for_cookies's poll interval.

    """timeout=None waits indefinitely — but always bails out the moment
    chrome_proc has exited. Without this, a crashed/killed Chrome left this
    looping forever: fetch_cookies() against a dead debug port just raises,
    and that's caught by the same `except Exception: pass` that's meant to
    tolerate Chrome being mid-navigation, so a permanent failure looked
    identical to a transient one. The process never returned, never hit
    the `finally` in main() that releases the lock, and never got reaped
    by the OS (visible as a `<defunct>` zombie in `ps`) — so a Chrome that
    crashed hours ago could still be silently blocking every future
    auto-relogin attempt, with no window on screen for anyone to notice.

    The 0.5s poll interval (not the 3s it used to be) matters more than it
    looks: try_auto_click() is a *fresh* Runtime.evaluate call on its own
    CDP connection, which — confirmed live 2026-07-18 — is the only thing
    that reliably clicks through the podmiotyzewnetrzne.login.gov.pl tile
    chooser. AUTO_CLICK_OBSERVER_JS's in-page MutationObserver (and a
    setInterval placed alongside it, tried and discarded) never fires at
    all on that specific page, even though the tiles are clickable within
    ~1s of landing — so this Python-side retry is the actual click-through
    mechanism there, not just a backstop, and the old 3s cadence was a
    real, visible stall directly on top of it. try_auto_click() is a cheap
    no-op once __ikw_stopped() is true, so polling this often for however
    long a human takes to scan the QR costs nothing but some idle loopback
    chatter.

    `observer_identifier` (from register_and_navigate()) lets this stop
    forwarding progress entirely — not just cheaply no-op — once the final
    auto-click target has definitely been reached: `reached_target` below is
    a plain Python-side latch, immune to AUTO_CLICK_OBSERVER_JS's own
    sessionStorage flag being origin-scoped (see that constant's own
    comment), and this loop stops calling try_auto_click() at all once it's
    set, on top of unregistering the observer script via
    remove_observer_script() so no future document — this tab's own
    fallback poll or the injected observer, on any origin, reached by
    forward or backward navigation — auto-clicks anything again.
